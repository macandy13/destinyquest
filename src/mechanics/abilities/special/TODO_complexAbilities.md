# Unimplemented Special Abilities (TODO)

The following abilities contain complex logic or unique mechanics that need 
individual implementation.

## Remaining (require multi-enemy combat support)
- Dark Master (Necromancer roll 6, zombie attacks Apprentice)
- Swarm of Spores (damage to shield based on cloud health)
- Magic of the Makers (defeated statue boosts Lorcan stats)

## Notes
Other complex abilities from the original list have been implemented in:
- `rollCheckAbilities.ts` - Roll-based damage checks
- `complexAbilities.ts` - Individual ability implementations
- `healingAbilities.ts` - Gathering Darkness
