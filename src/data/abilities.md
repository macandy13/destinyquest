# DestinyQuest Glossary: Special Abilities (Version 1.4)

The following is a list of all the abilities associated with special items and hero careers. The letters in brackets after each name refer to the type of ability:

* **(sp)**: Speed
* **(co)**: Combat
* **(mo)**: Modifier
* **(pa)**: Passive

### General Rules

* Unless otherwise stated, each ability can only be used **once per combat**, even if you have multiple items with the same ability.
* Passive abilities also follow this rule; for example, if you have two items with the *venom* ability, you can only have one *venom* effect in play at a time.
