Bugs:
- Roll Damage might only be applied once all rolls are confirmed (at damage dealing time)
- When changing the path, the current health should be set to max health.

Features:
- Support nodes
- Support full customization of state during combat
- Implement skill checks
- Support manually changing max health

Refactoring:
- Consolidate hero and enemy skills
- Convert from CSV to JSON during app load, avoiding the intermediate steps
